rfid-protector
==============

This project took several seconds to achieve (a Kickstarter was considered for it but finally not done), and aims at protecting 2 RFID cards from interferring when they're both inside the same pocket of a bag.

Design

Please follow the [associated diagram](https://github.com/ewjoachim/rfid-protector/blob/master/image.png) to make your own RFID Protector


Sustainable aspects
===================

This device can be produced using 95% of second hand recyclable material (a.k.a scrap paper) an a piece of tape.


Eletro-magnetic inteference
===========================

As far as the latest results in advanced physical research have let us see, there should be no efficiency drawback at wrapping a single standard sheet of paper around an RFID card. Additionnally, it is proved that increasing the distance between the card we want to use and any other card will lead to a better signal reading, and thus better results.


Specifications
==============

For best results, pocket must be less than 15cm wide and inside of pocket should be dry even in case of rain.
